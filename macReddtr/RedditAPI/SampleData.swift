Perhaps you can fault him for not trying hard enough, but you can\'t say he hasn\'t tried at all. I mean when you have tried to break into the RM first team for 7 years and haven\'t done so, it\'s probably fair to at least feel some doubt. Honestly I get that it\'s RM, breaking into the first team should be hard, but when do you give up? Most players aren\'t as talented as him, and can\'t even hit 2 seven years for a career.\n\nNot sure what exactly he wants from there, but I do agree promising a starting place is a big ask for RM. However, if the current coach specifically said that I was just a marketing propaganda or the like, I would also want some kind of guarantee. Also he\'s at the stage of his career where he really can kick off with regular game time, so I could kind of see why if he did ask for that.

Almost everyone knew it was a bad choice to sign for Madrid at that stage. You would think that his party would be at least aware that there might be a problem. I\'m almost certain that they sold him a rose-tinted picture when he signed. He literally could\'ve gone to any club in the world back then. RM might not have been able to keep the promise due to one reason or another, but the truth is that the original plan most definitely derailed.
